## Setup

It will take some time to put this on Firefox. Until then, please set it up locally. Don't worry it's easy. 

#### Download it locally
- Download the firefox.zip file and unzip it OR
- ```git clone https://github.com/Holmes7/CF-Submission-Count.git``` in your terminal

Remember where the Firefox directory is in your system. If you did git clone the directory is inside CF-Submission-Count directory.

#### Firefox Setup
- Put ```about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox``` in your Firefox URL bar and click enter
- Click on ```Load Temporary Add-on```
- Navigate to th firefox folder and click on the manifest.json file
- Visit any of the static Codeforces pages and check if it is working for a past or an ongoing contest. 

In case you are still having any issues please comment on the [Codeforces Blog](https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/80471) and I will help you out as soon as I can.
