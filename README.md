# CF Static Site Enhancer

This browser extension aims towards adding features to the static codeforces sites.

### Features include

* Friends standings.
* Copy button for copying input data to clipboard.
* Predicted rating change. (Uses the [CF-predictor's](https://cf-predictor-frontend.herokuapp.com) new backend server. Intended to only work during the contest)
* Submission count for the problems.

Each feature is accessible separately so that the browser doesn't make unnecessary computations.
